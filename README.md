Refactoring Homework for USCD Coding Bootcamp

In this assignment, it was my job to edit this an existing html code and make it cleaner. I was also responsible for improving the website's accessibility as well as appropriately commenting on the CSS page. 

As part of my edits, in the HTML I renamed tags to be semantic and to have more visual clarity. In addition, I added alt tags for the photos of the page. In the CSS file, I turned the header, content, and  benefits into flexboxes to move with the changes in page size. I corrected font size to make the page have uniformity and I organized the layout to account for the changes flex made to the spacing. 

My two struggles were adjusting the space between the content and the footer; I could only move the footer text, not reduce empty space. My other struggle was finding a way to make the benefits column go below the content boxes as the  page size got smaller.
